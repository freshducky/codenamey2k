# 🕰️ Y2K Time Machine

A cozy retro desktop experience built with Flutter, inspired by the aesthetic of early 2000s operating systems. It blends nostalgia with modular utility — letting users interact with draggable windows, a functional clock/calendar, a retro toolbar, and more.

## 🚀 Purpose

The Y2K Time Machine is both a love letter to early OS design and an experimental playground for UI prototyping, system emulation, and gamified interaction. It’s designed to evoke comfort, curiosity, and a little bit of chaos — blending utility apps with minigames, visual polish, and persistent in-app time.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Flutter** – UI toolkit for cross-platform development
- **Provider** – lightweight state management
- **Custom Window Framework** – built to simulate windowed apps with:
  - Moveable
  - Minimizable
  - Maximizable
  - Closeable behaviors
- **Drag-and-Drop System** – for rearranging app shortcuts
- **XP-Inspired UI** – styled using handmade gradients, assets, and shadows

## 🧠 What I’ve Learned

- **State Management**: Built shared state via Provider and custom managers for time and window tracking.
- **UI Fidelity**: Matching XP-style visual aesthetics requires nuance in padding, gradients, and layering.
- **Interaction Design**: Small flourishes like red dot indicators and drag shadows make the app feel alive.
- **Modularity Matters**: Separating apps into their own folders with clear responsibilities avoids bloat as the project scales.
